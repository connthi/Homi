# Coding Guidelines

## Swift
**Reference:** [Apple Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)

**Reasoning:** Provides consistent, idiomatic Swift style for readability, maintainability, and performance. Enforced via Xcode warnings and PR code reviews.

**Key Principles:**
- Use clear, descriptive names that avoid abbreviations
- Follow camelCase conventions (lowercase for variables/functions, uppercase for types)
- Prefer immutable values (`let`) over mutable ones (`var`) when possible
- Use Swift's type system effectively with optionals and generics
- Follow SwiftUI's declarative syntax patterns consistently

**Enforcement:** SwiftLint integration in Xcode, automated checks in CI/CD pipeline, mandatory code reviews for all Swift code changes.

## JavaScript (Node.js)
**Reference:** [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

**Reasoning:** Industry-standard style for readability and consistency. Enforced with ESLint during CI/CD pipeline.

**Key Principles:**
- Use meaningful variable and function names with camelCase
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var` for variable declarations
- Use arrow functions for short, simple functions
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use semicolons consistently
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use async/await over callbacks for asynchronous operations
- Follow Express.js conventions for route handlers and middleware

**Enforcement:** ESLint with Airbnb configuration, Prettier for automatic formatting, pre-commit hooks, automated testing in CI/CD pipeline.

## JSON
**Reference:** [RFC 8259 JSON standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259)

**Reasoning:** Standardized serialization format for API payloads. Checked via automated tests.

**Key Principles:**
- Use camelCase for property names to match JavaScript conventions
- Ensure all string values are properly escaped
- Use consistent data types (e.g., always use strings for IDs)
- Include proper error handling for malformed JSON
- Validate JSON structure matches API schema expectations
- Use meaningful property names that clearly indicate data purpose

**Enforcement:** Automated tests verify correct JSON structure and data types, API endpoint testing validates request/response formats, schema validation middleware in Express.js.

## Enforcement
- **PR reviews** ensure adherence to guidelines with mandatory approval from at least one team member
- **CI/CD pipelines** run linters (SwiftLint, ESLint) and fail builds with style violations
- **Automated tests** verify the correct JSON structure and data types for all API endpoints
- **Pre-commit hooks** prevent commits that don't pass linting checks
- **Documentation requirements** for all public APIs and complex functions
