This document contains the Week 6 progress summary for the **Homi** team.

## Team Report


### Last Week’s Goals
- Finalize and submit the **Homi Project Requirements and Process Document**.
- Implement **test-automation infrastructure** (Jest + XCTest integration).
- Expand documentation on architecture, schemas, and coding guidelines.
- Begin preparing **CI/CD workflow** for backend builds.
- Align all sprint 5 features with MVP milestones.


### Progress and Achievements


- **Documentation (Ebrahim & Hussein):** 
 Completed the *Homi Requirements and Process Document* detailing architecture, data models (MongoDB schemas), use cases, and testing plans. Added explicit descriptions of MVP features, stretch goals, and risk mitigation strategies. 


- **Test Automation (Ebrahim & Hussein):** 
 Integrated automated testing frameworks for both frontend (XCTest) and backend (Jest + Supertest). 
 Verified coverage of backend CRUD and catalog endpoints; ensured Swift unit tests compile successfully. 


- **Project Management (Connor):** 
 Consolidated documentation sections into a single, coherent deliverable. Finalized outline for architecture, team roles, and process sections. Coordinated peer review and submission. 


- **Frontend (Phong & Zubair):** 
 Supported documentation with system diagrams and architecture summaries. Began identifying next milestones for UI integration tests and performance polish in Week 7.

### Issues Encountered
- Coordinating multiple markdown documents into a single deliverable required formatting alignment between Xcode-exported figures and GitHub markdown. 
- Minor Jest configuration issues caused delays in CI testing setup; resolved by updating `package.json` test script.

### Plans and Goals for Next Week (Week 7 — External Testing & Bug Fixes)
- **Frontend (Phong & Zubair):** Polish UI/UX for SceneKit interactions and begin peer usability testing. 
- **Backend (Hussein):** Harden authentication and error-handling paths; add more unit tests for catalog queries. 
- **DevOps (Ebrahim):** Finalize CI/CD pipeline and run automated build checks for frontend and backend. 
- **Project Management (Connor):** Collect and synthesize external feedback for Week 7 demo; update testing checklist and bug tracker.
