# Weekly Status Report — Week 3

## Team Report

### Last Week’s Goals
- Finalize backend CRUD API for Layouts (create, read, update, delete).
- Implement frontend Save/Load UI components.
- Develop data serialization/deserialization logic for Layout objects.
- Connect Node.js backend to MongoDB Atlas.
- Coordinate client/server integration testing.

### Progress and Issues
- **Frontend (Phong – Layout & UI):**
  - Built the foundation of the iOS frontend using Swift and SceneKit.
  - Created a 3D room scene with working camera movement (pan, zoom, rotate).
  - Implemented object spawning for chairs and layout save/load functionality.
  - Faced Xcode build and git submodule issues due to nested project paths — resolved by cleaning and restructuring.
- **3D Interaction (Zubair):**
  - Implemented hit-testing logic to translate screen touches into 3D floor coordinates.
  - Began testing drag/drop gestures for furniture placement.
- **Backend (Hussein):**
  - Completed full CRUD API for Layouts, including MongoDB integration.
  - Resolved JSON parsing errors during integration testing.
- **DevOps (Ebrahim):**
  - Connected Node.js/Express server to MongoDB Atlas.
  - Encountered IP whitelist issue on Atlas; fixed by adding current development IP.
- **Project Management (Connor):**
  - Led daily stand-ups and verified frontend-backend data flow.
  - Updated project documentation and coordinated API testing sessions.

**Issues:**
- MongoDB initially rejected connections from local machines due to missing whitelist entries.
- Network request timing mismatch between Swift client and backend led to “invalidResponse” errors.
- UI lag observed during real-time object spawning — optimization planned in Week 4.

### Plans and Goals for Next Week (Week 4 – UI/UX & Initial Integration)
- **Frontend (Phong):**
  - Finalize dynamic camera controls and improve responsiveness.
  - Refactor 3D object spawning logic for smoother interaction.
  - Begin designing catalog selection menu for furniture items.
- **3D Interaction (Zubair):**
  - Connect Catalog API to frontend menus.
  - Refine drag/drop and placement gestures.
- **Backend (Hussein):**
  - Implement furniture catalog endpoints (GET /catalog).
  - Add query-based search and filter options.
- **DevOps (Ebrahim):**
  - Begin setting up CI pipeline for client builds.
  - Add server logging and basic monitoring.
- **Project Management (Connor):**
  - Prepare documentation for external feedback review.
  - Ensure cross-team alignment on data formats and integration tests.

#### Last Week’s Goals
- Implement Save/Load UI for layout persistence.
- Connect frontend to backend layout CRUD endpoints.
- Begin creating the 3D environment in Swift/SceneKit.

#### Progress and Issues
- Completed initial 3D room setup with interactive camera movement.
- Implemented object spawning (chairs) and integrated basic save/load functionality.
- Resolved multiple build errors related to Swift project setup and Xcode configurations.
- Debugged API request issues from frontend to backend.
- Tested layout serialization and persistence locally.

#### Plans and Goals for Next Week
